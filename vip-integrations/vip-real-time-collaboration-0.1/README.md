## FAQ

### Do I need special permissions to collaborate?

No additional permissions are required. Users can collaborate on any content they already have permission to edit in WordPress.

### What happens if my internet connection drops?

The plugin handles connection interruptions gracefully. If the connection becomes particularly unstable, your editing session will be paused to protect the document's integrity.

### Can I see who made specific changes?

The plugin shows live editing activity and user presence. For detailed change tracking, you can use WordPress's built-in revision system.

### How does conflict resolution work?

The plugin uses advanced algorithms to automatically merge changes from multiple users, preventing conflicts.
